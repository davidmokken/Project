__Goal of the project__
---
For the final project of the minor programming at the UvA, I will investigate and visualise if migrants and people from migrant backgrounds cause criminality in the Netherlands.

__Problem Statement__
---
In the week of May 16th "het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid" (Ministry of Justice) came under scrutiny when it released a report on crimes related to asylum seekers. 
The report had hidden the numbers of asylum seekers for suspected for serious crimes such as rape and murder under the heading 'other' and were therefore not included in the top 10 crimes for which asylum seekers were suspected. 
We live in times where people are afraid, especially of people who are different or come from another place than ours.
This in combination with lack of knowledge of the actual numbers of crime, asylum seekers and migrants have lead to forgone conclusions and fear/anger in many people towards "foreigners". 

__Solution__
---
Providing proper and easy to understand visualisations about crimerates, migrants and ethnicity might change people's perceptions about migrants and asylum seekers. We all might just get along after all.
