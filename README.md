***__Problem Statement and goal of the project__***
---
In the week of May 16th "het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid" (Ministry of Justice) came under scrutiny when it released a report on crimes related to asylum seekers. 
The report had hidden the numbers of asylum seekers for suspected for serious crimes such as rape and murder under the heading 'other' and were therefore not included in the top 10 crimes for which asylum seekers were suspected. 
We live in times where people are afraid, especially of people who are different or come from another place than ours.
This in combination with lack of knowledge of the actual numbers of crime, asylum seekers and migrants have lead to forgone conclusions and fear/anger in many people towards "foreigners".
The goal of this products is to provide proper and easy to understand visualisations about crimerates, migrants and ethnicity which hopefully might change people's perceptions about migrants. We all might just get along after all.

*External components*
- D3-tip
- Mapping

*Related Visualizations*
- 
*Hardest part*
- Linking the data map, in my case the Netherlands, to different pages for the provinces.
- Creating a format will be essential. If I correctly format the page, it will be much easier to link all the different data to the different pages
