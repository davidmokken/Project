# Day 1:

Plan: Write converters for the datasets (which are currently in csv format).
Finished: Wrote two converters. The two datasets are now in a multi-index dataframe. I adjusted my plan, again, as it now contains the bare minimum to pass.

Feedback sessie:
The feedback I received were mainly directed at the amount of work I planned to do. (Talisha)
The group suggested to adjust my bare minimum to contain three visualisations.


# Day 2:

Finished converting all data. Made a quick html page but that is the last step for me. Started with the data map but I still have trouble with combining it with the dropdown
